# SomethingTypeTTV
SomethingTypeTTV is a typing speed measuring tool made for the command line. (This might not work as well on single-thread terminals).
This is based on Python and the curses library (which comes pre-installed on Unix-based systems). This also uses an API made with node.js (included in the files, index.js) which needs to be ran separately using node.
If you want to add more quotes, just change the quotes list inside the "quotes.mjs" file.

SomethingTypeTTV was heavily based on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ5i1kJAA6Y. Cheers üç∫
